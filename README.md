Create Bubble Packages For PS3 OFW Using DTU Method

Tested On OFW 4.81

This will allow you to create bubbles on OFW using the DTU method and a CFW console.

It lets you drag & drop packages, edit XMB text, and change icon. Everything is automated and it will transfer all created files to the PS3 when finished. If you continue to make bubbles, the IP address is saved so you don't have to re-enter it every time.

From my testing, it will allow you to install any ORIGINAL package on OFW from a cute little bubble. The benefit of this at the moment seems meaningless, but I thought it was a neat setup to get bubbles on OFW. Maybe better things will be in the future!!
